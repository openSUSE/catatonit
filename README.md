## catatonit ##

[![Build Status](https://github.com/openSUSE/catatonit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openSUSE/catatonit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A container init that is so simple it's effectively brain-dead. This is a
rewrite of [initrs][initrs] in C, because we found that it is not possible to
statically compile Rust binaries without using musl. That was, in turn, a
reimplementation of other container inits like `tini` and `dumb-init`.

The reason for re-implementing `docker-init` is because it appears as though
all of the other implementations do not handle signals as correctly as they
should. In particular, they all appear to make use of `sigwait(2)` (`tini` does
a `sigtimedwait(2)` for an interval and then will do a `waitpid(2)` even if it
didn't detect a `SIGCHLD`). `catatonit` uses `signalfd(2)`, which [has its own
warts][signalfd-broken], but the improvements over `sigwait(2)` are significant
in terms of stability. Ideally we would just write a patch for the other
projects to use `signalfd(2)` rather than creating a new project, but after
some time spent looking at `tini` and `dumb-init` we felt that such patches
would be closer to full rewrites.

In addition, the purpose of `catatonit` is to only support the key usage by
`docker-init` which is `/dev/init -- <your program>`. With few exceptions, no
other features will be added.

### Usage ###

catatonit has identical usage to other basic `docker-init`'s -- you give it the
command and list of arguments to that command. If catatonit is not pid1, it
will try to use the sub-reaper support in the kernel. You can pass `-g` or set
the `CATATONIT_KILLPG` environment variable if you want signals to be forwarded
to the entire process group of your spawned process (otherwise it's just
forwarded to the process spawned).

If you wish to use catatonit as a convenient pause container (do not spawn a
child process nor do any signal handling), use pass `-P`.

### Installation ###

catatonit uses autotools for building, so building is a fairly standard:

```
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure
% make
% sudo make install
```
